# SvelteKit Cognito Authentication

This project is just an example about how to use SvelteKit with Cognito.

It was mainly created to illustrate this [blog post](https://robertohuertas.com/2021/07/25/sveltekit-cognito-authentication/).

Don't forget to add an `.env` file with your Client Id and your Client Secret of your Cognito App client:

```sh
VITE_CLIENT_ID=<your_client_id>
VITE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_client_secret>
```
